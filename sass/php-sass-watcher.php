/**
 * Class SassWatcher
 *
 * This simple tool compiles all .scss files in folder A to .css files (with exactly the same name) into folder B.
 * To keep things as minimal as possible, this tool compiles every X seconds, regardless of changes within the files.
 * This seems weird, but makes sense as checking for changes in the files is more CPU-extensive than simply
 * re-compiling them. SassWatcher uses scssphp, the best SASS compiler in PHP available.
 *
 * SassWatcher is not a standalone compiler, it's just a little method that uses the excellent scssphp compiler written
 * by Leaf Corcoran (https://twitter.com/moonscript), which can be found here: http://leafo.net/scssphp/ and adds
 * automatic interval-compiling to it.
 *
 * The currently supported version of SCSS syntax is 3.2.12, which is the latest one.
 * To avoid confusion: SASS is the name of the language itself, and also the "name" of the "first" version of the
 * syntax (which was quite different than CSS). Then SASS's syntax was changed to "SCSS", which is more like CSS, but
 * with awesome additional possibilities and features.
 *
 * The compiler uses the SCSS syntax, which is recommended and mostly used. The old SASS syntax is not supported.
 *
 * @see SASS Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_%28stylesheet_language%29
 * @see SASS Homepage: http://sass-lang.com/
 * @see scssphp, the used compiler (in PHP): http://leafo.net/scssphp/
 *
 * How to use this tool:
 *
 * 1. Edit $sass_watcher->watch( ... ); in the last line of this file and put your stuff in here, see the parameter
 *    list below.
 * 2. Make sure PHP can write into your CSS folder.
 * 3. Run the script:
 *    a) simple way, from browser, just enter the URL to scss-compiler.php: http://127.0.0.1/folder/php-sass-watcher.php
 *       The script will run forever, even if you close the browser window.
 *    b) PHPStorm users can run the script by right-clicking the file and selecting "Run php-sass-watcher.php".
 * 4. To stop the script, stop/restart your Apache/Nginx/etc. or press the red "stop process button in PHPStorm.
 *
 * The parameters:
 *
 *  1. relative path to your SCSS folder
 *  2. relative path to your CSS folder (make sure PHP has write-rights here)
 *  3. the compiling interval (in seconds)
 *  4. relative path to the scss.inc.php file, which is the main file of the SASS compiler used
 *     here. Download the script manually from http://leafo.net/scssphp/ or "require" it via Composer:
 *     "leafo/scssphp": "0.0.9"
 *  5. optional: how the .css output should look like. See http://leafo.net/scssphp/docs/#output_formatting for more.
 *
 * How the tool works:
 *
 * Every X seconds ALL files in the scss folder will be compiled to same-name .css files in the css folder.
 * The tool does not stop when a .scss file is broken, has syntax error or similar.
 * The tool does not compile when .scss file is broken, has syntax error or similar. It will only compile next time
 * when there's a valid scss file.

     * Watches a folder for .scss files, compiles them every X seconds
     * Re-compiling your .scss files every X seconds seems like "too much action" at first sight, but using a

     * Beside that, we are only compiling .scss in development, for production we deploy .css, so we don't care.
